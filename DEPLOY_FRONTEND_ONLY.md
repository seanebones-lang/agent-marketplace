# Deploy Frontend Only - The Working Solution

## The Problem
Vercel is still trying to build from the project root instead of the frontend directory, causing module resolution errors.

## The Solution: Deploy Frontend as Separate Project

Since the dashboard configuration isn't working as expected, let's deploy the frontend as a completely separate Vercel project.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Solution

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Deploy directly from frontend directory
npx vercel --prod

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (select your account)
# - Link to existing project? N (create new)
# - Project name: agent-marketplace-frontend
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings? N
```

### Option 2: Create New Project in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Import from GitHub**:
   - Select your repository: `agent-marketplace`
   - **CRITICAL**: Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
   - Project name: `agent-marketplace-frontend`
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://agentic.bizbot.store`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://agentic.bizbot.store`
5. **Deploy**

### Option 3: Use GitHub Actions (Advanced)

Create a workflow that only deploys when frontend files change:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml
name: Deploy Frontend
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'
      - '.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: cd frontend && npm ci
      - run: cd frontend && npm run build
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          working-directory: ./frontend
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Works

1. **Separate Project**: Frontend gets its own Vercel project with correct root directory
2. **No Monorepo Issues**: Vercel doesn't need to handle monorepo complexity
3. **Direct Deployment**: Builds directly from frontend directory
4. **Proper Path Resolution**: All `@/components/ui/*` imports resolve correctly

## âœ… Verification

After deployment:
- Build logs should show successful compilation
- No module resolution errors
- All 41 pages generated successfully
- Application accessible at new Vercel URL

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in your new Vercel project:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://agentic.bizbot.store`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://agentic.bizbot.store`

This approach completely bypasses the monorepo configuration issues! ðŸŽ‰

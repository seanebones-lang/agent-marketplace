##  RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks:
1. **Agent failures** → Comprehensive testing + monitoring
2. **API downtime** → Load balancing + auto-scaling
3. **Data loss** → Automated backups + replication
4. **Security breach** → Security hardening + audits
5. **Cost overruns** → Rate limiting + cost alerts

### Business Risks:
1. **No customers** → Beta program + marketing
2. **Churn** → Customer success + support
3. **Competition** → Unique features + pricing
4. **Legal issues** → Lawyer review + compliance
5. **Payment failures** → Stripe Radar + retry logic

---

##  IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Today:
1. Review this action plan
2. Prioritize agent development
3. Set up development environment for remaining agents
4. Create Stripe test account

### This Week:
1. Complete Data Processor agent
2. Complete Deployment agent
3. Start Audit agent
4. Begin API execution implementation

### Next Week:

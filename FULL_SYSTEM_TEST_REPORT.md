##  DETAILED FAILURE ANALYSIS

### Issue 1: Login Page Text Check (Non-Blocking)
**Status**:  Minor  
**Impact**: None (page loads correctly)  
**Details**:
- Test expected specific "Login" text pattern
- Page actually contains "Welcome Back" and "Sign in"
- Page is fully functional with correct content
- **Resolution**: Test expectation needs adjustment, not code

### Issue 2: Documentation Redirect (Expected Behavior)
**Status**:  Minor  
**Impact**: None (redirect is intentional)  
**Details**:
- `/docs` returns 307 redirect to `/docs/getting-started`
- This is correct behavior per `vercel.json` configuration
- Redirect is working as designed
- **Resolution**: Test should expect 307, not 200

### Issue 3: Charset Attribute Format (React Convention)
**Status**:  Minor  
**Impact**: None (valid React/Next.js syntax)  
**Details**:
- Test looks for `charset` (HTML attribute)
- Next.js uses `charSet` (React camelCase)
- Both are valid, React convention is correct
- **Resolution**: Test should check for `charSet`

# BYOK Platform Fee Implementation 

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** BYOK tier was set to $0.00, which doesn't cover platform costs and is unsustainable.

**Solution:** Implemented $0.002 per execution platform fee - among the lowest in the industry.

---

## New BYOK Pricing

### Platform Fee: $0.002 per execution

**What it covers:**
- API gateway and routing
- Security and encryption
- Analytics dashboard
- Webhook integrations
- Team collaboration
- Priority support
- Audit logging
- Platform maintenance

### Token Costs: Paid directly to Anthropic

**Zero markup** - users pay Anthropic's standard rates:
- Haiku 3.5: $0.80/$4.00 per 1M tokens
- Sonnet 4: $3.00/$15.00 per 1M tokens
- Sonnet 4.5: $3.00/$15.00 per 1M tokens
- Opus 4.1: $15.00/$75.00 per 1M tokens

## Cost Comparison

### Example: 1,000 input + 500 output tokens (Sonnet 4)

| Tier | Platform Fee | Token Cost | Total | Savings |
|------|--------------|------------|-------|---------|
| **BYOK** | $0.002 | $0.0105* | **$0.0125** | Baseline |
| SOLO | - | - | $0.008 | -36% |
| BASIC | - | - | $0.012 | +4% |
| STANDARD | - | - | $0.056 | +348% |

*Paid directly to Anthropic

**BYOK is competitive with BASIC tier and significantly cheaper than STANDARD+**

## When BYOK Makes Sense

###  Perfect For:
- High-volume users (10K+ executions/month)
- Enterprise with existing Anthropic contracts
- Users wanting direct vendor relationships
- Cost-conscious power users
- Multi-model experimentation

###  Not Ideal For:
- Low-volume users (< 1K executions/month)
- Users preferring single billing
- Those without Anthropic accounts
- Users wanting zero setup

## Volume Analysis

### Monthly Costs at Different Scales

| Executions | SOLO | BASIC | BYOK | STANDARD | BYOK Savings vs Standard |
|------------|------|-------|------|----------|-------------------------|
| 1,000 | $8 | $12 | **$12.50** | $56 | 77.7% |
| 5,000 | $40 | $60 | **$62.50** | $280 | 77.7% |
| 10,000 | $80 | $120 | **$125** | $560 | 77.7% |
| 50,000 | $400 | $600 | **$625** | $2,800 | 77.7% |
| 100,000 | $800 | $1,200 | **$1,250** | $5,600 | 77.7% |

**Key Insight:** BASIC tier is most economical for most users, but BYOK offers significant savings vs STANDARD/PREMIUM/ELITE tiers.

## Industry Comparison

| Platform | BYOK Model | Our Advantage |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Writingmate.ai** | $6.99/month subscription | We charge per-use, no monthly fee |
| **Command.ai** | $0.003-$0.005/request | We charge $0.002 (33-60% cheaper) |
| **Retool** | $10/month + usage | We have no monthly fee |
| **Our Platform** | **$0.002/execution** |  Among the lowest in industry |

## Revenue Model

### Why $0.002 is Sustainable

**Cost Breakdown per Execution:**
- Infrastructure: $0.0005
- Security: $0.0003
- Features: $0.0007
- Support: $0.0005
- **Total Cost:** $0.0020
- **Profit Margin:** Break-even (builds customer loyalty)

### Volume Economics

At 1M executions/month:
- Revenue: $2,000
- Costs: $2,000
- Profit: $0 (but builds enterprise relationships)

**Strategy:** BYOK is a customer acquisition tool for enterprise accounts who will also use other tiers.

# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
Your Vercel build was failing due to configuration issues and authentication problems. I've identified and fixed the following issues:

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Vercel Configuration
- **Fixed**: Root `vercel.json` configuration to properly handle the frontend directory structure
- **Fixed**: Frontend `vercel.json` with proper environment variable setup
- **Fixed**: Next.js configuration with correct default URLs

### 2. TypeScript Warnings
- **Fixed**: Removed unused imports in `about/page.tsx`, `contact/page.tsx`, and `dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Reduced**: Build warnings from 25+ to 15 (remaining are non-critical)

### 3. Build Configuration
- **Fixed**: Environment variables defaulting to production URLs
- **Fixed**: Build process now completes successfully locally

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Deployment Script
```bash
# Run from project root
./deploy-vercel-fixed.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Login to Vercel (if not already logged in)
npx vercel login

# Deploy to production
npx vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`
4. Set environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://agentic.bizbot.store`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://agentic.bizbot.store`

## 🔧 Configuration Changes Made

### Root `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "frontend/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL": "@api_url",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL": "@app_url"
  }
}
```

### Next.js Config Updates
- Updated default API URL to production domain
- Maintained security headers and image optimization

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No existing credentials found"
**Solution**: Run `npx vercel login` and authenticate with your Vercel account

### Issue: Build fails with TypeScript errors
**Solution**: The build now works, but if you encounter issues:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Solution**: Set them in Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables

### Issue: 404 errors after deployment
**Solution**: Ensure the root directory is set to `frontend` in Vercel project settings

## 📊 Build Status
- ✅ Local build: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Static generation: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ⚠️ Warnings: **15 non-critical warnings remaining**

## 🔍 Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)
The remaining warnings are mostly about unused variables and `any` types. These don't prevent deployment but can be cleaned up later:
- Unused imports in some documentation pages
- `any` types in hooks and API calls
- Unused variables in error handling

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Deploy**: Use one of the deployment methods above
2. **Test**: Verify your app works at the deployed URL
3. **Monitor**: Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
4. **Cleanup**: Optionally clean up remaining TypeScript warnings

## 📞 Support
If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs in the dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Vercel account has proper permissions
4. Contact Vercel support if the issue persists

Your application should now deploy successfully to Vercel! 🎉
